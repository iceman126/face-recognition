# Face recognition using dlib and knn :raising_hand_man:
A light weight example demonstrates facial recognition with dlib. The code is based on [dlib](http://dlib.net/) official examples and [How to Develop a Face Recognition System Using FaceNet in Keras](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-face-recognition-system-using-facenet-in-keras-and-an-svm-classifier/) tutorial

cd dlib/directory
python setup.py install
```
3. Run the code
```
python create_face_embeddings.py   # create embeddings
python train_model_and_predict.py
```
